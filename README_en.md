# Anime Presence Parser
**MAINLY FOR RUSSIAN-SPEAKING USERS**

Anime Presence Parser is a tool for displaying your anime watching status in Discord from the AnimeGO website and the Kodik player (integrated into AnimeGO). Created in a couple of hours just for personal use. Inspired by the official Crunchyroll Discord integration. ðŸ˜Š

## Features

- Shows the anime, current episode and it's progress in Discord Rich Presence
- Works right after entering an AnimeGO anime page
- Automatically updates your activity status

## Prerequisites

- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher recommended)
- **Discord** account (for creating an application)
- **Cloudinary** account (for image processing)
